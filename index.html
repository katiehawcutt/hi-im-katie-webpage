          <h2>Let's start with the basics...</h2>
          <p>
            I'm 31, I live in Birmingham, I play the saxophone, I love music,
            art and design, I'm a plant mom, I love the outdoors, travelling,
            climbing mountains and wild swimming, I enjoy baking, gardening and
            cycling, I love food (cooking and eating), and more recently (and
            excitingly) I have come to love coding!
          </p>
          <h2>Then...</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve spent the last 10 years working in the music industry as a
            professional saxophonist & tutor which has been fantastic! Since
            graduating from
            <a href="https://www.leedsconservatoire.ac.uk/" target="_blank"
              >Leeds Conservatoire</a
            >
            in 2010 with a BA(Hons)Jazz, I have worked with a number of
            different jazz, rock & pop bands playing at festivals, small venues
            and big theatres all over the UK. As well as gigging, I have also
            worked with some fantastic schools, music services and arts
            organisations to provide inspirational music education to young
            people and adults through ensembles, workshops and outreach
            programmes. It's been wonderful but recently I've felt like I want
            to get stuck into something new so I'm embracing a new challenge in
            life and learning to code!
          </p>
          <h2>Now...</h2>
          <p>
            Since I started learning to code earlier this year I’ve really taken
            to both the technical and creative aspects of programming. I've been
            learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript and I've loved the challenge of
            getting to grips with these new languages and implementing my
            new-found knowledge to create some really cool projects and apps. To
            document my progress I've been doing

            on Github. A few months ago I decided I wanted to take the plunge
            and work towards making it my career and I'm super proud to be able
            to say that I'm now a

            >
            Bootcamper 4.0 and a full-stack developer in training! Languages and
            topics covered on the bootcamp are HTML, CSS, Advanced Javascript,
            Node.js, API's, DB's, React and Cloud Hosting, with a focus on
            project work and team work. By the end of the course, I will have
            learned the fundamentals of programming, know how to work in a high
            performance tech team, and I will be specialised in full-stack
            JavaScript development.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've made this website as part of my pre-bootcamp homework and I've
            restricted myself to the use of HTML & CSS as per the instructions!
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm currently working on my portfolio (so please watch this space!)
            but you can see some of the projects I've been working on so far on
